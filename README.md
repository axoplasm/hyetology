A list of words for rain, suitable for use by Pacific Northwesterners.

#### Drizzle
Light rain. You *think* you don’t need a raincoat when you go out, but after an hour or so you are soaked. 

#### Freezing rain
Rain that passes through a layer of sub-freezing air. Distinct from *snain* in that it does not form flakes. Hurts when it hits your face.

#### Horizontal rain
Any rain driven by strong wind.

#### Inverted rain
A drizzle, usually in very still air, that gets you wet even when you’re wearing a raincoat or using an umbrella.

#### Liquid sunshine
Steady cold drizzle for hours on end, most common in winter

#### Pineapple express
Warm, windy rain, blowing directly off the Pacific, usually from the south-to-west.

#### Snain
Huge snowflakes falling when the air is just at the point of freezing, that melt instantly and do not accumulate

#### Sneet
Snow and sleet, only barely “rain” in the vaguest sense. May accumulate, but is too cold and wet for anything fun like sledding or making snowpeople.

#### Sun shower
Rain broken by occasional patches of sunshine, most common in spring

#### Wintry mix
Snow mixed with rain. May also contain *sleet,* *freezing rain,* or *sneet.* Distinct from *snain* in that it may accumulate as slush.
